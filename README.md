# Adventure game â€” Instructions
This project is about making a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game using python programming language. 
This is a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. For this project, the idea is to focus on some key
things that we need if want to make a working game:
*   The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
*   Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
*   The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
*   The game has conditions for winning and losing.
*   When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.  

These are the key features this project will need to have in order to make it into a playable game:
*   Print descriptions of what's happening for the player
*   Give the player some choices
*   Make sure the player gives valid input
*   Add functions and refactor the code
*   Use randomness in the game
*   Create win and lose conditions
*   Check if the player wants to play again
*   Check your style with `pycodestyle`
